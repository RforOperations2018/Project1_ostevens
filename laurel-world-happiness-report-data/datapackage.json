{"name":"laurel_world-happiness-report-data","title":"World Happiness Report Data","description":"World Happiness Report 2017\nSource: http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2017/\n\n#World Happiness Report Data for 2017\nfrom their website: \n> The first World Happiness Report was published in April, 2012, in support of the UN High Level Meeting on happiness and well-being. Since then the world has come a long way. Increasingly, happiness is considered to be the proper measure of social progress and the goal of public policy. In June 2016 the OECD committed itself “to redefine the growth narrative to put people’s well-being at the center of governments’ efforts”. In February 2017, the United Arab Emirates held a full-day World Happiness meeting, as part of the World Government Summit. Now on World Happiness Day, March 20th, we launch the World Happiness Report 2017, once again back at the United Nations, again published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and now supported by a generous three-year grant from the Ernesto Illy Foundation. Some highlights are as follows.\n\nSee the Statistical Appendix attached for the following information\n* 1 Data Sources and Variable Definitions\n* 2 Coverage, Summary Statistics and Regression\nTables\n   \nSource: Helliwell, J., Layard, R., & Sachs, J.
